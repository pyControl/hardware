# Tower assembly instructions

## Tools and equipment

- Electrical tape
- Conformal coating spray, e.g. Ambersil 30235-AB acrylic conformal coating spray.
- 2.5mm Hex key
- Pliers
- Two part epoxy
- Vaseline

## 1. PCB conformal coating

Apply a conformal coating to tower PCBs to protect from water damage.  Before spraying the PCBs, cover the connectors and speaker with electrical tape as shown in the photo above.  Apply the conformal coating to both sides of the PCBs in a well ventilated area, using appropriate PPE.

## 2. Fluid delivery tube

Glue the fluid delivery tube into part *tower1_5mm_white_acrylic_110_x_110mm* using epoxy.  Check the orientation of the part carefully to ensure the tube is located on the correct side.  

## 3. Assembly

Position part *tower3_1mm_white_HIPS_28x34mm* on part *tower2_5mm_clear_acrylic_110_x_110mm* and locate 20mm M3 Cap head bolts in holes.

Flip assembly over and apply a thin layer of Vaseline around the hole in the center; this forms a water-tight seal around the base of the poke.
